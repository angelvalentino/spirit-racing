## 📋 About

[Spirit Racing](https://spirit-racing.netlify.app/) is an e-commerce **single-page application (SPA)**, featuring a JSON mock back-end, developed from scratch using **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript** , and **React**. Inspired by [DoomsdayCo](https://doomsdayco.com/) design and featuring product images from [Iron Heart](https://www.ironheart.co.uk/). The platform offers a diverse range of high-quality jackets designed for both safety and style. With its **responsive**, **user-friendly**, and **accessible** interface, Spirit Racing ensures a seamless shopping experience.

> Employing React best practices, I prioritized meticulous **component organization**, **structured file management**, and enforced **immutability**. My emphasis was especially on optimizing code for enhanced performance, readability and accessibility.

## 🌱 Spirit Racing: Evolution, Features and Limitations

### Development Approach

- **Goal:** A fully functional, accessible e-commerce site that showcases high-quality motorcycle jackets with dynamic content loading.
- **Crafted with Care:** Every feature has been developed with best practices, ensuring a clean, modular, and scalable codebase.
- **Accessible Event Handling:** Extensive use of React Context API, `useState`, and `useEffect` for managing state and component lifecycle events to ensure smooth interactions as well as integrating proper WAI-ARIA support..

### Current Limitations

While the project follows modern development best practices, it currently uses a mock back-end via JSON to simulate API calls. The shopping cart does not have authentication mechanisms in place for user data, and there is no checkout functionality. The project simulates the UI and is designed for demonstration and educational purposes, not for production use.

📌 Notwithstanding, there are no current plans to update this project, as it's considered to already fulfill its purpose in a clear, accessible, and responsive way.

### Accessibility (a11y) Overview

- **Inclusive Design:** The application was built with inclusivity in mind, ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** The entire site, including modals, carousels, and forms, supports full keyboard navigation.
- **ARIA Support:** ARIA attributes are applied judiciously to enhance accessibility without overcomplicating the markup, ensuring smooth interaction with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Semantic HTML:** Semantic HTML elements are used throughout to improve both accessibility and SEO, enabling assistive technologies to accurately interpret the content structure.

### Architecture Overview

- **Modular Design:** The app follows a component-based structure, leveraging React’s strengths for clear separation of concerns.
- **Optimized Performance:**  Built with minimal dependencies, the app ensures fast load times and a smooth user experience, optimized with Webpack and Babel for efficient bundling.
- **Reusable Components:** Includes reusable components for easier maintenance and scalability.
